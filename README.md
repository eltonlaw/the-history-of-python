The scraper is written in Python, it's a pretty standard scrape with the main workhorse a combination of Requests, Beautiful Soup and Pandoc. The formatting is a bit wonky since all the scraping and processing is generalized so things can be done automatically. Feel free to send a pull request to either change the code or the individual markdown files.
