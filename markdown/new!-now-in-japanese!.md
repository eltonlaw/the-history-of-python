###  New! Now in Japanese!

There's now a [Japanese translation](http://python-history-jp.blogspot.com/)
of this blog. Yay! There is also a [Spanish
version](http://elornitorrincoenmascarado.blogspot.com/), and a French version
(sorry, I don't know the URL yet -- let me know if you do).  
  
I don't read those languages (or not well enough) and am not in a position to
"approve" them, but I'm fine with their existence. If you want to start
another translation, be my guest -- send me a link to the blog so I can update
this page. If you see a mistake in a translation, just contact the translator
directly. (However, I do not want to see copies of my blogs appearing. There's
no point for those, and typically sites that copy popular blogs are just
trying to attract eyeballs to their ads by reproducing popular material
without putting any creative work into it.)
