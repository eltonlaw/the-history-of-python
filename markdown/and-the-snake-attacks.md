###  And the Snake Attacks

Alright. Fine. In 1995, when I was first exposed to Python, any reference to
"snake" was verboten. Python was named after [Monty
Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), not the reptile. If
anybody was attacking, it was [Knights who say
Ni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_who_say_Ni) or possibly the [Rabbit
of Caerbannog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog).  
  
In any case... back in 1994, I was battling fictitious baddies in the LPMUD
scene. The Web was barely present, and broadband was unheard of. Low-bandwidth
entertainment was the order of the day.  
  
Wait. One more step back. 1979. My first computer was an Apple ][, and one of
my favorite games was the [Colossal
Cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave). Soon after that, I learned
about and played Zork. I fell in love with the concept of interaction fiction
and how a computer could lead you through these stories. These games hooked
me, and led me into a life of computers. _(and yes, you can imagine my ecstasy
at meeting Don Woods some 25+ years later!)_  
  
So the MUD scene was quite interesting to me. But I wanted to help _build_
these games. I met [John Viega](http://viega.org/), a fellow [LPMUD game
author](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_Mudlib), coder, and designer. At the
time, he was working at the University of Virginia in their Computer Graphics
Lab, working on a system called Alice. Their system was intended for less
computer-savvy and they wanted an easy-to-learn language for people to create
animations. They chose Python for its clarity, power, and simplicity.  
  
John was a huge fan, and pointed me at Python. "You have to learn this!"
"Fine. Fine.", I said. The language was easy, yet powerful. It could do
everything, without a lot of hassle.  
  
That was February, 1995, and I haven't turned back.  
  
Little did I know, at the time, just how pivotal Python would be to my career
and my life. Thank you, Guido, for your creation.
