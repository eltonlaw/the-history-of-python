###  A Brief Timeline of Python

The development of Python occurred at a time when many other dynamic (and
open-source) programming languages such as Tcl, Perl, and (much later) Ruby
were also being actively developed and gaining popularity. To help put Python
in its proper historical perspective, the following list shows the release
history of Python. The earliest dates are approximate as I didn't consistently
record all events:  
  
  
**Release Date**|  **Version**

December, 1989| Implementation started  
1990| Internal releases at CWI  
February 20, 1991| 0.9.0 (released to alt.sources)  
February, 1991| 0.9.1  
Autumn, 1991| 0.9.2  
December 24, 1991| 0.9.4  
January 2, 1992| 0.9.5 (Macintosh only)

July 29, 2003| [2.3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/)  
November 30, 2004| [2.4](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4/)  
September 16, 2006| [2.5](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/)  
October 1, 2008| [2.6](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/)  
December 3, 2008| [3.0](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)  
I've added hyperlinks to the releases that are still being advertised on
python.org at this time. Note that many releases were followed by several
micro-releases, e.g. 2.0.1; I haven't bothered to include these in the table
as otherwise it would become too long. Source tarball of very old releases are
also still accessible, here: <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/src/>. Various
ancient binary releases and other historical artefacts can still be found by
going one level up from there.
